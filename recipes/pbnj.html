        <p> This is how I personally make my peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.
            They are a nice snack and rarely fail to satisfy. Their only real
            downside is that they are not very filling for the calories. Other than
            that though they are a hood classic.

        <p>
            In today's recipe we will be actually making an <em>almond butter</em>
            and jelly sandwich, because that's what I have an open jar of right now.
            Without further ado, let's get into it.
        </p>

        <h3 class = "Ingredients">Ingredients:</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>2 pieces sourdough bread</li>
            <li>1-2 tablespoons almond butter</li>
            <li>1-2 tablespoons Trenton's strawberry jam</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class = "Steps"> Steps:</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Pop your bread in the toaster and get them nice and browned</li>
            <li>Once the toast pops up, toss em on a paper plate and get your spreads ready </li>
            <li>Using a spoon, spread an even coat of Trenton's jam onto one piece of toast</li>
            <li>Optionally wash the spoon off, before using it to spread a coat of almond butter onto
                the other piece of toast
            </li>
            <li>Mate the two halves of the sandwich and set the assembled unit back on the plate</li>
            <li>Grab a big kife, and cut the sandwich on its <strong>diagonal</strong></li>
            <li>Serve</li>
        </ol>
